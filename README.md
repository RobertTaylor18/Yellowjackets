> A roguelike dogfighting game that is funky, goofy, and skilful, where you must trek through many hazardous environments to defeat swarms of animal enemies and bosses. Using money and items you become stronger, sturdier, and unlock new abilities.
Of all the insectoid combatants, the Yellow Jackets strive to become _the bee's knees_!

## Branch Workflow
* The `development` branch contains the most up to date version of the game.
* The `main` branch should always contain a playable version of the game (e.g. something we would be willing to test or to release).
* When adding stuff or making changes, developers should create a new branch off the `development` branch, make their changes, then merge back into the `development` branch, and delete the branch they created.
* Branches are `named-like-this`.
* Old branches that we still want to keep around/archive are `DEAD-named-like-this`.
